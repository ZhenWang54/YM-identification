# YM-identification
For the Journal of Royal society Interface accessing
This matlab code is the underlying code for Young's modulus identification.
Run Main_simulation_US_Disp_use.m：
Get the calculated R-Young's-modulus: R-Youngs= 3.2435；

Run Main_contact_force_generationB.m
get the B-Young's-modulus: real modulus of 8% is 11.4 Kpa, the calculated Young's modulus is10.3083
